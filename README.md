## What is differential equation?

However, the networks only can learn 

## What is Physics-Informed_Neural_Networks(PINNs)?
In short, PINNs is a network that can learn how to solve the differential equation

## What is 
A constraint added to the loss function

In deep learning, we used to calculate the loss between the prediction and the ground-truth
